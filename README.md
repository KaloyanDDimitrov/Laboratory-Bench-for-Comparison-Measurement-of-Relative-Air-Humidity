# Laboratory-Bench-for-Comparison-Measurement-of-Relative-Air-Humidity

This code was developed as part of the "Development of a Laboratory Bench for Comparison Measurement of Relative Air Humidity" project,
which was a thesis for the University of Rousse "Angel Kanchev." The project was coded and developed by Kaloyan Dimitrov.

The objective of this project was to design and build a laboratory bench that can accurately and reliably measure relative air humidity,
and facilitate the comparison of different measurement devices and methods. The bench has practical applications in industries such as meteorology,
agriculture, and HVAC, and represents an important contribution to the field of air quality measurement.

For any questions or comments regarding the project, please refer to the thesis documentation.
